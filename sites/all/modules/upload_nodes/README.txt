WARNING : This module is very experimental and SHOULD NOT be used in production sites. It is in active development and this version is not stable at all.

This module allows users to upload multiple files at once and create one node per file.

Once enabled, go to Configuration / Media / Upload nodes and enable some fields (you need to have content types with either image or file fields).

In the navigation menu, you will have a "Upload nodes" entry. This is a temporary entry point for upload nodes.
